            Disneyland opened in Anaheim, California on July 17th, 1955. From the very first day of operation, it was incredibly popular, and it was easy to see why. The first of park of its kind in United states, Disneyland was a unique entertainment experience for both children and adults. Prior to Disneyland, anything that might be refered to as an amusement park was either places that were considered too seedy or dangerous to take children, or were places for the children to have all the fun while the parents sat and watched. It was at once such place, Griffith Park in Los Angeles California, while sitting on a park bench as his daughters rode a merry-go-round, that Walt Disney first envisioned the park that would become Disneyland. He wanted a place where children and parents could have fun together. Construction began on July 16th, 1954. Yes, you read that correctly. Disneyland was build in just one year and one day.

            Opening day was, to put it bluntly, a disaster. More than half the people who entered the park that day did so with forged tickets. Many just hopped the fence. This caused massive shortages thoughout the park, with most feed and beverages sold out before the afternoon. The temperature in Anaheim that day soared to a sweltering 101 degrees. That heat, combined with asphault streets that had been freshly poured only days prior, reportedly resulted in the heels of womens shoes sinking into the pavement as they walked. And as if that were not enough, a gas leak forced the closure of 60% of the park only hours after its opening.

            Undetered, Walt Disney stepped to the microphone that morning to deliver the dedication speech for Disneyland. I've included video of this speech, which was watched live by over 90 million viewers as part of a special broadcast by the ABC network. Though it was a rough beginning, the magic of the park could not be denied. Over five million people visited the park within that first year, and attendance has grown steadily ever since. The park has undergone many changes in its nearly seven decades of operation. Originally opened with 5 themed areas of the park, it has since been expanded several times to add new "lands" to the originals. New Orleans Square was the first of these additions, opening in 1966. Next was Critter Country (originally named Bear Country) in 1972. Mickey's Toon Town was added in 1993. Finally, Star War's Galaxy's Edge was opened in 2019. Further, both Fanstasyland and Tomorrowland have undergone extensive updates from their opening day appearences.
