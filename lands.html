                    Inspired by Walt Disney's hometown of Marceline, Missouri, Main Street, U.S.A. is designed to resemble the center of a turn-of-the-20th-century American town. The first area guests of the park enter after coming in the front gate and passing through a tunnel under the tracks of the Disneyland Railroad, this small slice of Americana transports guests back to a simpler time. Horse-drawn carriages and double decker busses cruise up the length of the road, while the sounds of the train echo from Main Street Station. In the distance, Sleeping Beauty's Castle beckons you further into the park. You may hear a barbershop quartet siging old tunes of yesteryear, or see The Disneyland Band marching down the road. Lastly, above the fire station next to City Hall, you will see a single lamp glowing in the window. This lamp is inside Walt Disney's private apartment inside the park and was turned on to signal that Walt was in the park that day. Diseyland now keeps the lamp lit 24/7 to signify that the spirit of Walt Disney forever lives in the park he created.

                    Heading to the southwest of the hub at the end of Main Street, park guests are enticed forward by the sight of thatched rooftops and tiki torches. A large tiki mask gazes down upon them over the sign declaring the strange new world they are about to enter. One of the five original lands, Adventureland is designed to appear as a marketplace located in a dense tropical jungle, blending African, Caribbean, and Pacific influences. Located right at the entrance from the hub, Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room has been entertaining guests since 1963. This was the first attration to feature Audio-Animatronics, which would become a staple of Disney attractions. The merchants offer supplies for your jungle excursions, as well as unique wares from the local craftsmen. The smell of exotic local foods waft through the air. All through the land, the drum beats and chants of the native jungle tribes can be heard beckoning you deeper into the jungle. Walking away from the shops and restaraunts, brave guests can become intrepid explorers by stepping into the dockhouse of the Jungle Cruise, delve into the mysterious grounds of the Temple of the Forbidden Eye, or climb Tarzan's Treehouse.

                    Guests heading west from the centeal hub will see the gates of a log fort leading them back in time to the days of the Wild West. Frontierland is a snapshot of America's expansion westward and as gusts walk through it they experience the progress from rugged wilderness to more civilized railways, riverboats, and roads. Built to resemble an old west mining town, Frontierland seamlessly blends the rough and tumble world of Davy Crockett with the modern sensibility of Mark Twain. Elk and deer antlers adorn the top of the general store, so that cowboys know immediately where they can aquire supplies. And though there are no horses tied in front of the Golden Horseshoe Cafe, the sounds of the stage performers and cheering crowds let you know the local watering hole is always busy. Along the Rivers of America, guests can board the Mark Twain Riverboat, a 5/8-scale stern-wheeler steamboat that in 1955 was the first of its kind to be build in the US in over 50 years. Also sailing guests around the River is the Columbia, a 3-masted sailing ship deisgned as a replica of the first US ship to circumnavigate the globe, the Columbia Rediviva. At the center of the river sits Tom Sawyer Island. Guests can take a ferry to the island and explore its winding trails and tunnels. Just watch out for pirates!

                    By far the most recognizable feature of the park, standing at the north side of teh central hub is Sleeping Beauty's Castle. This iconic structure serves at the main entrance to Fantasyland, one of the five original lands and reportedly Walt's favorite. Within this area, which feels like it was plucked straight out of a fairytale, guests will find numerous rides based on classic disney animated features. Many of these rides have been a part of Disneyland since its very first day of operation. The catsle itself was designed to be seen from almost everywhere in the park, as was intended as a landmark for guests to use so that they could easily find their way back to the central hub no matter where they were. Originally decorated in a renaissance style, in 1983 it was remodeled to resemble a Bravarian villiage, which helps create the fairytale look of the land. It is also home to the second largest feature in the park, Matterhorm Mountain. There guests can ride the Matterhorn Bobsleds, which was the first steel tubular track rollercoaster and revolutionalized rollercoaster construction  worldwide. North of the Matterhorn, you will find the whimsical home of It's a Small World. Originally a part of the 1964 New York World's Fair, the ride was relocated to Disneyland in it's entirety in 1966.

                    Tomorrowland was the last of the five original lands to be completed, and has also seen the most changes out of any of the original lands. Located to the east of the central hub, guests can tell they are headed into a futuristic setting by the look of the large, rotating spire of Astro Orbiter. Passing under an archway, guests find themselves a land that encompasses what Disney Imagineers have envisioned for the future, though that vision has chaged a lot since 1955. Many futuristic attractions can be found in this land, including another iconic Disney attration, Space Mountain. Autopia, an opening day attration, can be found here as well. Guests have been driving its highways and byways for 66 years. Tomorrowland is also home to the Disneyland submarine fleet, part of the Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage. Walt Disney once dubbed these the "largest fun time fleet of submarines in the world". Lastly, located directly above the loading docks of the submarines is the boarding platform for the Disneyland Monorail, the first permanent monorail system in the western hemisphere. This futuristic transport shuttles guests between its Tomorrowland station and a station located outside the park in the Downtown Disney District, close to the three Disneyland Resort hotels.

                    Based on the real world US city of New Orleans as it looked in the 19th century, New Orleans Square was the first land to be added to Disneyland after the park opened. More of a series of streets than an actual "square", it was also the last area of the park, and contained the last two attractions, that Walt himself would have a hand in designing. The land opened in July of 1966, less than 6 months before Walt would pass away. Located on the banks of the Rivers of America, New Orleans Square can be reached by passing through Frontierland or Adventureland. Here, guests are surrounded by the sights and sounds of the deep south, with jazz music echoing through the streets of the French Quarter inspired buildings. Since the original city of New Orleans was an important post city on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, it natually made sense that there be an attraction about pirates in the land. Pirates of the Carribean can be found right near the entrance to New Orleans Square. On the other end of the square, past the shops and restaraunts, guests can visit the Haunted Mansion and its "999 happy haunts".

                    On the far side of New Orleans Square, past the Haunted Mansion, guests will find one of the smallest lands in the Disneyland Park, Critter Country. Originally named the Indian Villiage and considered part of Frontierland, the area was rethemed in 1972 to become the seventh themed land in Disneyland. Towering over the entire area is Splash Mountain. This attraction sends guests on an exciting log ride ending in a thrilling drop of 16m (52.5ft) into a small splash pool. Riders are often soaked by the time they exit the ride, which can be a refeshing cooldown during the hot California summers. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh can be found here as well. Formerly the home of the Country Bear Jamboree, it was converted to a Winnie the Pooh themed dark ride in 2003. FInally, if you feel like working out your arms, Davy Crockett's Explorer Canoes can be boarded here for a trip arounf the Rivers of America. This is the only attraction powered exclusively by guests. The canoes have no motor, and are powered only by the rowing of its passengers and the two guides that accompany them.

                    Mickey's Toontown is the 8th land opened in the park. Located past It's a Small World attraction, this largely child-focused area opened in Disneyland in 1993. The area is inspired by Who Framed Roger Rabbit and resembles a set from a Max Fleischer cartoon. The buildings are stylized and colorful. There are several attractions involving classic cartoon characters, such as the houses of Mickey and Minnie Mouse, and a small children's coaster. The main draw of this land is as a place where you can meet many of Disney's most well known classic characters, as they all make this area their home. The fictional backstory given for Mickey's Toontown is that it was a hidden Toon suburb that Mickey Mouse had moved to in 1930 to keep in touch with his humble Midwestern roots, with his friends following soon after. When Walt Disney was looking for a location to build Disneyland, Mickey pointed him towards a large orange grove nearby for him to build his park. After the park opened, Mickey and his friends would travel between their Toontown homes and Disneyland to meet the countless guests that visited the park, before eventually deciding to open their hometown to the public later in the 90’s, digging a tunnel through the berm.

                    Galaxy's Edge, the 9th land in the park and Disneyland's most recent addition, is a themed area inspired by the Star Wars franchise opened in 2019. It's setting is the villiage of Black Spire Outpost on the remote planet of Batuu. Entering this land, guests are transported to a galaxy far, far away to experience their own adventures in this treasured sci-fi setting. Guests can meet and interact with well know characters from the Star Wars universe. They can pilot infamous Millenium Falcon, recreated in full scale as the centerpiece of the land, on the Smuggler's Run attraction. Feel free to purchase a drink from the cantina, then peruse the shops in the marketplace for goods sourced from every corner of the galaxy. There's even a rumor that you can aquire your own custom built lightsaber, the weapon of the legendary Jedi, if you can find the hidden shop they are made in, though I doubt such rare items come cheap. Finally, the truly adventurous can join the fight against the First Order by riding Rise of the Resistance, the newest and most advanced attraction at Disneyland.
