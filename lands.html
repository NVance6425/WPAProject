                    Inspired by Walt Disney's hometown of Marceline, Missouri, Main Street, U.S.A. is designed to resemble the center of a turn-of-the-20th-century American town. The first area guests of the park enter after coming in the front gate and passing through a tunnel under the tracks of the Disneyland Railroad, this small slice of Americana transports guests back to a simpler time. Horse-drawn carriages and double decker busses cruise up the length of the road, while the sounds of the train echo from Main Street Station. In the distance, Sleeping Beauty's Castle beckons you further into the park. You may hear a barbershop quartet siging old tunes of yesteryear, or see The Disneyland Band marching down the road. Lastly, above the fire station next to City Hall, you will see a single lamp glowing in the window. This lamp is inside Walt Disney's private apartment inside the park and was turned on to signal that Walt was in the park that day. Diseyland now keeps the lamp lit 24/7 to signify that the spirit of Walt Disney forever lives in the park he created.

Horse-drawn carriages and double decker busses cruise up the length of the road, while the sounds of the train echo from Main Street Station. In the distance, Sleeping Beauty's Castle beckons you further into the park. You may hear a barbershop quartet siging old tunes of yesteryear, or see The Disneyland Band marching down the road. Lastly, above the fire station next to City Hall, you will see a single lamp glowing in the window. This lamp is inside Walt Disney's private apartment inside the park and was turned on to signal that Walt was in the park that day. Diseyland now keeps the lamp lit 24/7 to signify that the spirit of Walt Disney forever lives in the park he created.
